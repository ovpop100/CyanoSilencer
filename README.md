# CyanoSilencer

Identification of putative silencer in Cyanobacteria using secondary structure homology.

### 1)
  - filter out putative candidates by protein length. Expected length is similar to H-NS / LSR2 etc... (>=100 <200 amino acids)

### 2)
  - calculates PSMM matrix using psiblast

### 3)
  - predict secondary structure by SPIDER 2 program
